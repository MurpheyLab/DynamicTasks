\title{Preliminary Analysis of Stroke Participant's Movement}
\author{Milli Schlafly}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

Analysis notes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Movement when the ball is green is removed. (Only matters for 1 or 2 participants)
	\item Movement when participant is not lifted is removed. (Negligible effect on results)
	\item Window of +/- 0.3Hz
\end{itemize}

Ball frequency is a significant factor in nearly every ANOVA that was performed. Because this result could be due to factors other than the participant's ability to produce motion at the ball's resonant frequency, I do not note if ball frequency is significant in this document.

For the 1Hz ball, arm does not have a significant effect on the energy at resonance (p=0.124). For the 0.5Hz ball, arm has a significant effect on the energy at resonance (p=0.030). Within the paretic arm, loading does not affect energy at resonance (p=0.893).}
